Development and study of a complete interchange 




The road network plays an essential role in the development of a country because it represents
a base on which is based several sectors such as the transport of goods and people; therefore it is
the vital means of the economy and social development of a country. This socio-economic growth
requires the public works sector to expand the road network.


A motorway interchange is a system of road ramps allowing to switch, either from one type of
road network to another (from an ordinary road or a fast lane to a motorway), or from one motorway
to another. Interchanges are therefore located at intersections between road networks of different
types and thus make it possible to avoid any level crossing to limit the slowing down of the lanes
concerned.


A motorway interchange has at least one bridge allowing one road network to span the
other. In the most complex cases, the carriageways can be spread over four different levels (so-called
"four-stack" interchange).


In this context, our project is split into 4 chapters. Starting with the first chapter in which
we will give you a bibliographic search about interchanges. Then, the second chapter is devoted
to the study of traffic and the proposal of the interchange variant. The next chapter consists of
dimensioning the pavement structure using "ALIZE". Finally, we end with modeling of a slab
bridge by finite element method using "SAP2000".
